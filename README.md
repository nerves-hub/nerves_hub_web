# NervesHub

[![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/nerves-hub/nerves_hub_web.svg?style=svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/nerves-hub/nerves_hub_web)

This is the source code for the NervesHub firmware update and device management
server.

**Important**

This is the 2.0 development branch of NervesHub. If you have been using
NervesHub prior to around April, 2023 and are not following 2.0 development, see
the [`maint-v1.0`
branch](https://github.com/nerves-hub/nerves_hub_web/tree/maint-v1.0). The
`maint-v1.0` branch is being used in production. 2.0 development is in progress,
and we don't have guides or good documentation yet. If you use the 2.0
development branch, we don't expect breaking changes, but please bear with us as
we complete the 2.0 release.

## Project overview and setup

### Development environment setup

For best compatibility with Erlang SSL versions, we use Erlang/OTP 23.0.4. If
you're coming to NervesHub without OTP 23 or earlier devices, don't worry about
this. OTP 23.0.4 is difficult to install on Apple M1/M2 hardware so developing
on Linux is highly recommended if you're keeping to the OTP 23.0.4 requirement.

The `.tool-versions` files contains the Erlang, Elixir and NodeJS versions.
Install [asdf-vm](https://asdf-vm.com/) and run the following for quick setup:

```sh
cd nerves_hub_web

asdf plugin-add nodejs
bash ~/.asdf/plugins/nodejs/bin/import-release-team-keyring # this requires gpg to be installed
asdf install
```

Modify the `.tool-versions` if you want to use a later version of Erlang.

You'll also need to install `fwup` and `xdelta3`. See the [fwup installation
instructions](https://github.com/fhunleth/fwup#installing) and the [xdelta3
instructions](https://github.com/jmacd/xdelta).


On Debian/Ubuntu, you will also need to install the following packages:

```sh
sudo apt install inotify-tools
```

Local development uses the host `nerves-hub.org` for connections and cert
validation. To properly map to your local running server, you'll need to add a
host record for it:

```sh
echo "127.0.0.1 nerves-hub.org" | sudo tee -a /etc/hosts
```

### First time application setup

1. Setup database connection

     NervesHub currently runs with Postgres 10.7. For development, you can use a local postgres or use the configured docker image:

     **Using local postgres**

     * Make sure your postgres is running
     * If you need to edit the `DATABASE_URL`, create a `.env.dev.local` and `.env.test.local` to adjust to your local postgres connection

2. Fetch dependencies: `mix do deps.get, compile`
3. Initialize the database: `mix ecto.reset`
4. Compile web assets (this only needs to be done once and requires python2 or a symlink for python3):
   `mix assets.install`

### Starting the application

* `mix phx.server` - start the server process
* `iex -S mix phx.server` - start the server with the interactive shell

> **_Note_**: The whole app may need to be compiled the first time you run this, so please be patient

Once the server is running, by default in development you can access it at http://localhost:4000

In development you can login into a pre-generated account with the username
`nerveshub` and password `nerveshub`.

### Running Tests

1. Make sure you've completed your [database connection setup](#development-environment-setup)
2. Fetch and compile `test` dependencies: `MIX_ENV=test mix do deps.get, compile`
3. Initialize the test databases: `MIX_ENV=test mix ecto.migrate.reset`
4. Run tests: `make test`

### Self Hosting

1. Set up an Ubuntu 22.04 server
1. Get a domain and edit DNS to point at your IP
1. You will need an SMTP login from somewhere like Mailgun or Sendgrid
1. `./bin/remote` and setup your `./remote_host` file
1. `./bin/remote setup` to do basic setup
1. Follow the TODOs at the end of the basic setup, edit the environment file, create a postgres user, generate certs, update the Caddyfile, etc
    1. Make sure you save the ca cert and key you generated, as your devices will need the ca.pem cert chain
1. `./bin/remote deploy` to do your first deploy

At the end of this you should have a NervesHub instance that will respond on 443 for the web and 4001 for a device to connect to. Devices will need your `ca.pem` file generated if you followed along with the setup TODOs. NervesHubLink will use this to validate your connection.

If you're self hosting, there may be minor problems that aren't covered here. Self hosting is a best effort through the scripts provided.

### Client-side SSL device authorization

NervesHub uses Client-side SSL to authorize and identify connected devices.
Devices are required to provide a valid certificate that was signed using the
trusted certificate authority NervesHub certificate. This certificate should be
generated and kept secret and private from Internet-connected servers.

For convenience, we use the pre-generated certificates for `dev` and `test`.
Production certificates can be generated by following the SSL certificate
instructions in `test/fixtures/README.md` and setting the following environment
variables to point to the generated key and certificate paths on the server.

```text
NERVESHUB_SSL_KEY
NERVESHUB_SSL_CERT
NERVESHUB_SSL_CACERT
```

### Tags

Tags are arbitrary strings, such as `"stable"` or `"beta"`. They can be added to
Devices and Firmware.

For a Device to be considered eligible for a given Deployment, it must have
*all* the tags in the Deployment's "tags" condition.

### Potential SSL issues

The OTP versions running on the device and server must be compatible or devices
won't be able to connect. See [this google
sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1PS7gKR66PCNR3GFOVCgaraMrhT5dOjk7BnERNMZmY-s/edit?usp=sharing)
for the gory details.

OTP > 24.2.2 switched to use TLS1.3 by default and made quite a few fixes/changes
to how it is implemented in the `:ssl` module. This has affected the setup of
client authentication in a few different ways depending on how you have your
server and device configured:

| Server | Client | Effect |
| --- | --- | --- |
|TLS1.3 | TLS1.3| `certificate_required` error (needs OTP 25.2 - see https://github.com/erlang/otp/issues/6106)  |
|TLS1.3|TLS1.2|  `CLIENT ALERT: Fatal - Handshake Failure - :unacceptable_ecdsa_key` - Happens because the client is attempting to sign with `:she` as the signature algorithm. The workaround is to specify `ssl: [signature_algs: [{:sha256, :ecdsa},{:sha512, :ecdsa}]]`|
|TLS1.2 | TLS1.3 or TLS1.2 | Successful|
